        <h1>Personal Expense Tracker</h1>

            <li><a href="#" rel="noopener">Live Demo (In-Progress)</a></li>

        </ul>

        <p>
            The primary goal of this project was to demonstrate the knowledge I've gained with 
            the Microsoft .NET technology stack for developing an MVC web application. The 
            secondary goal was to create something my close friends and family and I could use 
            for personal expense tracking. This application is an evolving work in progress with
            more features and tools to come as I develop myself as a .NET Software Engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application is separated in two parts.  The first is a Entity Framework Core 
            backend or data-access layer with an MSSQL database.  The second is an Angular MVC 
            front-end or presentation layer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This application was designed with the help of:
            <ul>
                <li>Bootstrap 5.0 - as a CSS framework to simplify the development of commonly
                    used components.</li>
                <li>FontAwesome - for quick access to pre-designed icons.</li>
                <li>Syncfusion - as an extensive component library with access to complex 
                    feature-rich components that aid with the visualization of data.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The current live version is Demo with the following available features:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pie and Spline Charts for data visualization.</li>
            <li>Complete CRUD for expenses, categories, and more.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
