            This project was requested by the Career Resource Center (CRC) at SUNY New Paltz.
            It seeks to simplify the process of finding staff and students on campus to complete 
            necessary paperwork for things like internships that require as many as 8 participants
            by moving the creation and submission of this paperwork to a responsive web-application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Minimal external libraries and frameworks were used per client's request. The 
            technologies used were HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL relational-database, 
            and W3.CSS. The features of this version are as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete responsive design overhaul</li>
            <li>Assign up to 8 participants in sequence</li>
            <li>Send and recieve applications</li>
            <li>Create custom applications</li>
            <li>Messaging and notifications</li>
